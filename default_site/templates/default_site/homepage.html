            <p>
                At makewebwork we start by creating a functional website and a data model to enable you to do everything you need right now.
                We then look at where you want to be in the future. You might have a blog or e-commerce business today but plan on turning it into a subscription 
                model in the future we lay the groundworks for what you need now and start work on the subscription model in the background while you're 
                busy creating. When you are ready the subscription model will be too all you have to do is unlock it for a fee and it becomes functional 
                straight away.
